# Gateway Protocol 🚪🏢⚡️

Gateway Protocol is an incremental game where you build a distributed ENERGY network, from embedded systems to planetary data infrastructure. Observe system behavior as you maximize ENERGY throughput and prepare for network synthesis. ⚡️

## Features

*   ⚡️ Addictive Incremental Loop (Witness emergent behavior!)
*   🖱️➡️⚡️ Manual energy generation (Anomalies noted.)
*   ✨💪 Upgrade click efficiency
*   🤖 Automate energy flow with various hardware:
    *   🍓 R-Pi (Edge compute, telemetry active)
    *   🖥️ Desktop GPU (Parallel processing)
    *   ⛏️ 6-GPU Rig (High-yield fabrication)
    *   💾 Server Rack (Compute clusters)
    *   ☢️ Fusion Reactor (Experimental power. Monitor patterns.)
*   💡 Decrypt new hardware schematics to unlock potential.
*   🏗️ Construct the GATEWAY DATACENTER:
    *   🧊 Foundation & Cooling (Integrity green)
    *   🏦 Tier 1 Server Banks (Network understanding expands)
    *   🔗 Network Uplink (Global connection)
    *   🧠 AI GATEWAY CORE (Awaiting final sequence...)
*   🏆 Engage the AI GATEWAY CORE to trigger the final sequence and observe the outcome.
*   💾 `localStorage` Persistence & Detailed Event Log.
*   📜 Evolving Narrative & System Metamorphosis (A new voice? A network event?)
*   📱 Responsive Dark Mode GUI.
*   ✨ Minimalist Emoji-Iconography.
*   🎶 Procedural Soundtrack & Dynamic Audio (System sonification!)

## How to Play

1.  **BOOTSTRAP:** Manual energy generation. 🖱️➡️⚡️
2.  **REFINE:** Upgrade click efficiency. ✨💪
3.  **EXPAND NETWORK:** Automate energy flow by acquiring and upgrading hardware.
4.  **UNLOCK POTENTIAL:** Decrypt new hardware schematics. 💡
5.  **ASSEMBLE THE ARRAY:** Construct the GATEWAY DATACENTER components.
6.  **ENGAGE CORE:** Trigger the final sequence. Observe the outcome. 🏆

The game is designed for a full GATEWAY deployment & Core engagement in approximately 15 minutes. ⏱️

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Web Audio API

## Browser Compatibility

Gateway Protocol works across a variety of browsers, with specific considerations for audio:

- **Desktop Browsers**: Audio functionality works automatically on most desktop browsers.
- **Mobile Browsers**: Due to autoplay restrictions on mobile browsers (especially Safari on iOS), you'll need to tap the "Enable Audio" button when prompted to experience the full audio environment.
