# Gateway Generator - Design Document

## Core Concept

A clicker game where the player builds up an energy generation empire. Starting with manual clicks, the player unlocks progressively more powerful and automated methods of energy generation, from small devices to large-scale datacenters, ultimately aiming to build a "Gateway Datacenter".

## Core Gameplay Loop

1.  Player clicks the main button to generate a small amount of **Energy**.
2.  Player uses **Energy** to buy upgrades.
3.  Upgrades can:
    *   Increase the amount of **Energy** generated per click (EPC).
    *   Automatically generate **Energy** over time (Energy Per Second - EPS).
4.  Player unlocks new tiers of upgrades or new types of generators as they progress.

        - [ ] Base Cost: ~300,000 Energy.
        - [ ] Base EPS: 1,200 EPS per unit.
        - [ ] Cost scaling per unit: `cost = baseCost * 1.30^owned`.
        - [ ] UI and Logic: Similar to Tier 1.
        - [ ] Implement Unlock Condition visibility (show/hide section, temporary glow, permanent once unlocked).
    - [ ] **Tier 5: "Miniature Fusion Reactor" (Advanced Generator)**
        - [ ] Unlocks: Late game (e.g., Player Energy >= 50,000,000).
        - [ ] Base Cost: ~75,000,000 Energy.
        - [ ] Base EPS: 50,000 EPS per unit.
        - [ ] Cost scaling per unit: `cost = baseCost * 1.35^owned`.
        - [ ] UI and Logic: Similar to Tier 1.
        - [ ] Implement Unlock Condition visibility (show/hide section, temporary glow, permanent once unlocked).
    - [ ] General Logic: Need a game loop (`setInterval`) to add `totalEPS` to `Energy` every second and update displays.
        - [x] Implemented basic game loop updating Energy and displays.
        - [x] Implemented `totalEPS` calculation and display.

### UI/UX Enhancements

## Technology Stack

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   Vanilla JavaScript

## Notes

*   Focus on satisfying progression and the chosen theme.
*   Costs and EPS values are estimates and will need playtesting and iteration.
*   Consider interplay between click and auto-generation (e.g., click boosts based on % of EPS).
*   Unlock conditions can be a mix of Energy owned and units of previous tier owned. Unlocks are permanent once achieved for a game session.
